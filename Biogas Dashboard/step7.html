<h3><b>STEP 7:</b> USE YOUR BIOGAS</h3>
    
Once your gas storage tank is set up, itâ€™s time to connect it to your end-user devices. These devices can be gas burners, 

stoves, generators, or any equipment specially designed to use biogas. 
    
Proper ventilation is vital, so make sure you have good airflow in the areas where you use biogas. This helps prevent 

any potential issues with gas buildup or inadequate oxygen supply. Regularly check for any signs of leakage and promptly 

address them to keep things safe and efficient.
