<h3><b>STEP 5:</b> ESTABLISH OPTIMAL OPERATING CONDITIONS</h3>
To keep things cozy inside the digester, maintain the temperature between 30 and 40°C (86 – 104°F). 

This temperature allows the bacteria to work their magic efficiently and provide a consistent biogas flow for your 

daily needs. 

Another metric to watch closely is the pH — how acidic or alkaline the digester environment is. 

Ideally, the pH level stays between 6.5 and 8.0. If you notice any deviations from this range, use pH buffers or additives 

to correct the imbalance. 
    
Remember that the bacteria inside the biodigester need a start-up period to adapt to the new environment. Depending on 

the type of digester and the feedstock, it can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks. So, be patient and let nature 

take its course as the microorganisms settle in.
