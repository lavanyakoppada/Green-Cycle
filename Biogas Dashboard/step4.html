<h3><b>STEP 4:</b> LOAD AND MIX WASTE IN THE DIGESTER</h3>
Load the organic waste into the biodigester to get things rolling. You can combine carbon-rich materials (food waste or 

agricultural residues) and nitrogen-rich materials (animal manure).
        
Depending on the type of digester and the feedstock used, you want to follow a specific feedstock-to-water ratio to ensure 

a perfect balance. For example, if you use cow dung, you’ll need 10 liters of water for every 10 kg (22 pounds) of waste. 

If you experiment with different feedstock compositions, adjust the water amount accordingly, considering that the ideal 

moisture range for efficient biogas production is typically between 70 and 80%.
        
Now, here’s the fun part – stirring! Mix waste and water thoroughly to create a smooth and homogenous slurry. 

It’ll help those hardworking microorganisms do their job effectively.
        
As you add more feedstock, maintain moisture levels so that anaerobic digestion happens under the best possible conditions. 

If the waste is too dry, add water. Conversely, add dry organic materials like sawdust or straw if it’s too wet.
